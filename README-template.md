## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Add their email and submit the form
- See a success message with their email after successfully submitting the form
- See form validation messages if:
  - The field is left empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Links

- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://your-live-site-url.com)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

What I learned is to become more concise on what I am creating especially this one. It is a form validation so I should be careful and did my best so that the users will not be confuse on their experience and what they see.


### Continued development

Form validation in not part of my favorites. In fact it is one the things I hate to create. However, maybe I can spend more time on improving my skills on it.
